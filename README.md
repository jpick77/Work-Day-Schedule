# Description
For this challenge, I was given a starter code and was tasked with refactoring the given code to make the Work Day Scheduler more accessible for a user. I added multiple different time blocks to the HTML to correspond with the average work day of 9-5. Then with JavaScript, I created a variable of the current day and then used JavaScript built-in day.js format so the current day stays updated. After I created a function displaying the current time using military time. Then created an if statement saying that if the current time was > the number of the military hour the row would show the color corresponding to "past". Then I created an else if statement saying that if the current time was < the row would read "future". And if the current time = the time then the row would read "present". Finally, I created a function that when the save button was pressed, the task was saved to local storage and the task would stay on that row even when the page is reloaded.

# Installation
I used JavaScript, jQuery, and third-party APIs to display a planner for the average worker to delegate different tasks at different times of the work day.
